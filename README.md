# 06 Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

## User Story
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```
## Acceptance Criteria
This website follows the acceptance criteria of:
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## Description
For this assignment I created html, css, and javascript pages. The main page allows a user to enter the name of a city and once they press enter it returns the daily forecast
as well as a following 5 day forecast displayed on screen. This is done by utilizing an API and having a distinct API key which is done through javascript. Once a search is entered
it is also saved underneath so you can go back to that city's forecast.
